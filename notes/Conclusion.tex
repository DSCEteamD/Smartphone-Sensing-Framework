\section{Current State}

\subsection{Evalutation}
\label{sec:org350e527}
\begin{itemize}
\item How reliable can our implementation detect clap.
\item Benchmark
\begin{itemize}
\item How many time false positives where detected ( 20x husten, 20x schnipsen, 20 klatschen)
\item Show statistics by trying it out (maybe in different environments (loud,
silent rooms, outdoors)
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

Refer to to evalution part above. State how difficult this was and the time
needed to try out more advanced solutions (AI) was not enough.

\section{Project Outlook}
\label{sec:orgfa9fd4b}
Maybe add more debug functionallity inside the App, be able to not only tweak
parameters inside the code, but also with UI Controls inside the app.

Whistling detection instead of clapping.
